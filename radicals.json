{"character": "\u4e85", "meaning": "Barb", "mnemonic": "This radical is shaped like a barb. Like the kind you'd see on barb wire. Imagine one of these getting stuck to your arm or your clothes. Think about how much it would hurt with that little hook on the end sticking into you. Say out loud, \"Oh dang, I got a barb stuck in me!\""}
{"character": "\u5927", "meaning": "Big", "mnemonic": "This radical looks just like a stick figure\u2014more specifically, a really big guy with his arms stretched out nice and big. When you see this radical, just think big, because this guy is really BIG!"}
{"character": "\u5de5", "meaning": "Construction", "mnemonic": "You know those big steel girders that are used for the frame of big buildings? This is like the end of one of those, and has a very distinct shape, just like this radical. These girders are used in construction, which is why this radical means construction. Funny thing is, you use these girders to put together buildings just like you're going to use this radical to put together kanji!"}
{"character": "\u5341", "meaning": "Cross", "mnemonic": "This radical looks like a cross. I mean, just look at it. Two bars going through each other = a cross!"}
{"character": "\u4e36", "meaning": "Drop", "mnemonic": "This little radical is a drop of water or some other liquid. Notice how it's only one drop? Sometimes radicals or kanji will have more than one drop, so it's important that you know how to tell them apart."}
{"character": "\u5165", "meaning": "Enter", "mnemonic": "Watch out! This isn't the person radical, it's something else. What's the difference? The right side is longer than the left side. And on computers, it usually has that extra part sticking out of the top. It kind of looks like a flap opening to a teepee. And what do you do with an opening? You enter it! That's why this radical is enter."}
{"character": "\u30cf", "meaning": "Fins", "mnemonic": "Picture a fish. Now picture the fish a little worse, like a child's drawing of the fish. Now erase the fish's body and... you're left with two fins! Do you see these two fins? Yeah, you see them."}
{"character": "\u4e00", "meaning": "Ground", "mnemonic": "This radical consists of a single, horizontal stroke. What's the biggest, single, horizontal stroke? That's the ground. Look at the ground, look at this radical, now look at the ground again. Kind of the same, right?"}
{"character": "https://files.wanikani.com/hz1r0trxcprt8t2tjbebgzchjpsz", "meaning": "Gun", "mnemonic": "This looks a lot like a long gun pointing to the right. You have a shoulder rest on the left, and the barrel on the right. Imagine it hanging in a case on the wall in a museum."}
{"character": "\u4ea0", "meaning": "Lid", "mnemonic": "This looks like something you'd put on a kettle or a pot, right? It even has a little handle to make sure you don't burn yourself. This is some kind of lid."}
{"character": "\u5c71", "meaning": "Mountain", "mnemonic": "This is a mountain. You'll have to add the lines that make up the top of the mountain if you want it more \"mountain-like.\" Also something that might help: sometimes mountains have a couple of smaller peaks coming out the side of the main peak too. Connect the dots and create the mountain in your mind."}
{"character": "\u53e3", "meaning": "Mouth", "mnemonic": "A big, gaping, square hole represents someone opening their giant mouth to tell you something stupid."}
{"character": "\u4e5d", "meaning": "Nine", "mnemonic": "If you look at this radical in just the right way, you'll notice that it kind of looks like the letters \"n\" and \"i\" (the \"i\" comes from the little flippy-up stroke on the right side). What do the letters \"n\" and \"i\" start spelling? Why, the word nine."}
{"character": "\u4eba", "meaning": "Person", "mnemonic": "If you were to draw a person with just strokes like you see in kanji, you'd create a stick figure, maybe something like this: \u5927. But this is just a person, not someone holding out their arms to show how big they are. So their arms are down, which makes them look like a torso with a pair of legs. Maybe they're walking too, which is why their legs are spread out like that. You can see the person now, can't you?"}
{"character": "\u529b", "meaning": "Power", "mnemonic": "Imagine a guy flexing his arm downward to show off his steroid-pumped arm. It's huge. It's so full of power. RARRRWWWRRR!!"}
{"character": "\u52f9", "meaning": "Prison", "mnemonic": "This looks like an enclosure of sorts - that's why it's a prison. It wraps itself around things and locks them in there. Prisons are pretty scary, even before you imagine one slowly floating down from the sky to trap you."}
{"character": "\u5ddd", "meaning": "River", "mnemonic": "This radical already looks like a river. See the banks of the river on the side and the flow of the river in the middle? There's even a slight turn in the river too. So when you see this radical, you should think \"river.\""}
{"character": "\u4e03", "meaning": "Seven", "mnemonic": "What does this radical look like? Hmm, nothing much. What about if you turn it upside down? Now does it look like a 7 with a line through it? Close enough to help you to remember that this radical is seven, right? Just remember, when you see this radical, flip it over and see what number it looks like. If you can do that, you can remember the meaning!"}
{"character": "\u4e3f", "meaning": "Slide", "mnemonic": "Close your eyes and imagine you're a kid again. Now open them and... look! It's a slide! Imagine little you sliding down this slide over and over, having a great time. Imagination + emotion makes for good memorization!"}
{"character": "\u4e28", "meaning": "Stick", "mnemonic": "This is a stick, sticking out of the ground. It even looks like a stick."}
{"character": "\u65e5", "meaning": "Sun", "mnemonic": "Since there are no circles in Japanese characters, sometimes rectangles or squares have to make do. In this case, this big rectangle is the sun. The middle line going through the center horizontally is the equator. Or maybe it's a cloud, moving across the sun. Picture it, but don't actually look at the sun and burn your eyes!"}
{"character": "\u30c8", "meaning": "Toe", "mnemonic": "This radical looks just like the katakana character \u30c8 (to), which sounds like the word toe. So when you see \u30c8, think toe."}
{"character": "\u6728", "meaning": "Tree", "mnemonic": "Do you see the tree in here? It has branches, and then it has the foliage coming down diagonally from it, spreading out like a tree would. That's why this radical is a tree."}
{"character": "\u4e8c", "meaning": "Two", "mnemonic": "One line plus another line equals two lines. This radical represents the number two. Pretty simple, right? Can you guess what three looks like? I bet you can..."}
{"character": "\u5973", "meaning": "Woman", "mnemonic": "This radical looks like a wide person made up of two stacked Xs. Women generally have two XXs for chromosomes, and back in the day they were praised for their wide, child-bearing hips. We may not think of women this way anymore, but way back when Japanese was made, this made them think of a woman."}
{"character": "\u672c", "meaning": "Book", "mnemonic": "There's a cut right at the base of this tree. Why would someone cut down a tree? To make a book out of it! Imagine living in the old days when you'd have to cut down a tree yourself to write or read a book."}
{"character": "\u5f13", "meaning": "Bow", "mnemonic": "This radical looks like a fancy composite bow people would use to shoot at targets and definitely not any normal living animals. See how the middle part is being pulled back? Imagine holding this bow and firing it at a target shaped like a giant alligator-crab monster."}
{"character": "\u5b50", "meaning": "Child", "mnemonic": "This radical is made up of two barbs and one ground radical. If there are barbs on the ground, whom (especially) do you want to avoid that area? You want your child to avoid it, since children are so careless and often don't wear shoes. Imagine how bad you'd feel if you let a child walk around on top of these barbs! Pretty bad, I imagine."}
{"character": "\u725b", "meaning": "Cow", "mnemonic": "There's a cross and a gun, with the gun going through the cross. You're using the cross to stabilize your gun, because you need to shoot a cow for dinner. You bring your cross because you need to bless the cow once you've killed it (and it's also a good stand for your gun). Poor cow."}
{"character": "\u571f", "meaning": "Dirt", "mnemonic": "There's a cross drawn on the ground, making this dirt. You can draw anything in the dirt, it just happens to be a cross this time. Imagine drawing a cross in the dirt with your finger. Feel the dirt get stuck under your fingernail and never forget."}
{"character": "\u72ac", "meaning": "Dog", "mnemonic": "Remember the big guy that helped you remember the big radical? Now the big guy has something on his shoulder... what is that? You look and see that he has a dog up there, perched as if it were a parrot or a cat or something. Dogs aren't supposed to be up on people's shoulders like that, but for him? It works!"}
{"character": "\u5915", "meaning": "Evening", "mnemonic": "Do you see the prison and drop radicals making up this radical? This prison is holding onto a drop because it's the evening. Evening air does a better job of holding on to drops of liquid like this, which is why everything is covered in dew in the morning."}
{"character": "\u76ee", "meaning": "Eye", "mnemonic": "See the iris in the middle of the eyeball? Remember that there are no round things in kanji, so square things take their place. That makes this a pretty realistic, square eye. You just have to squint with your real eyes a bit."}
{"character": "\u706b", "meaning": "Fire", "mnemonic": "See the person radical here? It's got things coming off of it... what are those things\u2014OH MY GOD IT'S FIRE!!! Help, help! Put the fire out!"}
{"character": "\u4e94", "meaning": "Five", "mnemonic": "If you use your imagination, this radical actually looks like the number \"5.\" You have to remove the vertical line in the bottom left, but once you do that, you have an easy way to remember that this radical means five."}
{"character": "\u5c38", "meaning": "Flag", "mnemonic": "See the flag in this radical? There's a pole with a flag on the end of it, blowing in the wind. Basically, this radical looks just like a flag."}
{"character": "\u5f61", "meaning": "Hair", "mnemonic": "These three streaks flowing off to the side are three strands of hair. Pretty easy to see and remember, right?"}
{"character": "\u624b", "meaning": "Hand", "mnemonic": "This one's a little tough to picture, but I believe in you. The barb in the middle is the wrist/arm. Then, there are four regular fingers coming off of it and then one big thumb (the slide radical at the top). So you have four fingers, a thumb, and a wrist. This is what makes up your crazy looking hand."}
{"character": "\u5182", "meaning": "Head", "mnemonic": "This is the kind of head a child might draw\u2014can you imagine it with eyes, nose, mouth, and ears too? Whoever's head this is, it's really square. Maybe it's the head of a famous spongy cartoon character. Hmm."}
{"character": "\u5929", "meaning": "Heaven", "mnemonic": "There is a two radical and a person radical. The first level of a person's life is on earth. The second level (this level, which is why there's a two radical here) is in heaven. So when you see a person at level 2, you know they're in heaven."}
{"character": "\u738b", "meaning": "King", "mnemonic": "This radical is not something anyone can have. Only a king can wear this crown upon his head. This radical is the sign of kings. Imagine your favorite king wearing this on their head. It's a pretty distinctive shape\u2014I think you can do it."}
{"character": "https://files.wanikani.com/93t725nw1lpvtrlse0qxqviid52e", "meaning": "Leaf", "mnemonic": "There's a leaf on top and a stem going down out of it, making it the leaf radical. It looks kind of like a lilypad, sitting on top of the water with its stem going down to the bottom where the dirt is."}
{"character": "\u513f", "meaning": "Legs", "mnemonic": "This radical already looks like a pair of legs. There's even feet on these legs (unlike the fins radical, which you learned earlier). That's how you know these are legs and not fins (or something else)."}
{"character": "\u4e2d", "meaning": "Middle", "mnemonic": "There's a stick going right through the middle of someone's mouth! Imagine that mouth being yours. Measure the placement of the stick. Perfectly aligned, right in the middle. That's amazing, though to be honest, you probably have bigger problems than measuring the location of this stick in your mouth."}
{"character": "\u6708", "meaning": "Moon", "mnemonic": "The moon is actually made of the sun, but it has little legs coming off of it leaning towards the left. Why? Because the moon is always running away from the sun as fast as it can. It doesn't want to get caught on fire, so it has to run to stay ahead!"}
{"character": "\u30ca", "meaning": "Narwhal", "mnemonic": "This radical looks like the katakana character \u30ca (na), which we're going to say stands for narwhal. Plus, this radical kind of looks like a narwhal, right? The body and head on the bottom, and the single majestic narwhal horn coming out the top, shooting up out of the water and into the air. Oh, and don't confuse this radical with treasure. The sideways line for narwhal (\u30ca) is horizontal, the sideways line for treasure is at more of a downward angle (\u30e1), like an \"X.\""}
{"character": "\u30e0", "meaning": "Private", "mnemonic": "This is a little triangle that's almost completely closed off. When you want to be alone, you hide in a place where you can be in private. That's why this is the private radical. You're closing yourself off to the rest of the world, with just a little peephole."}
{"character": "\u7530", "meaning": "Rice Paddy", "mnemonic": "Rice paddies are made up of fields with irrigation lines going between them. See the four rice paddies with water flowing between and around them? That's why this radical is rice paddy."}
{"character": "\u5c0f", "meaning": "Small", "mnemonic": "You have fins and you have a barb. A fish that you can stick an entire barb through like this would have to be really small, since it's sticking through the whole fish body (which you can imagine by basing the body off the size of the fins compared to the already small barb.)"}
{"character": "\u7acb", "meaning": "Stand", "mnemonic": "Two sticks are propping up a lid. By doing this, they're making it stand up."}
{"character": "\u6b62", "meaning": "Stop", "mnemonic": "There's a giant toe and a stick in the ground in front of you. You're driving your car toward them, but you don't see them until your lights hit them. What would these things cause you to do? Most likely stop your car right away."}
{"character": "\u4e01", "meaning": "Street", "mnemonic": "There's a barb under the ground, holding it in place. This is actually a street. All streets have to be secured to the ground with barbs so that they don't slide all over the place. If you tried to pick up the asphalt streets we have today, you'd still find barbs under the ground to keep them there. The more you know! \u2b50"}
{"character": "\u5200", "meaning": "Sword", "mnemonic": "If you look at this radical, it looks like the bottom part of a sword\u2014the handle, more specifically. This radical also looks a lot like the power radical (\u529b), so don't get them confused. It's missing the little nubbin at the top, because 90% of the power comes from the sword to cut your enemies down (which is why the sword radical is 90% of the power radical)."}
{"character": "\u5343", "meaning": "Thousand", "mnemonic": "You're in a room, surrounded by slides. Down off the slides tumble cross after cross after cross. They're bouncing in and hitting you in the face, the arm, everywhere... With each cross comes a voice yelling, \"ONE! TWO! THREE HUNDRED! FIVE HUNDRED!\" and so on. You are worried it will never end, because you're starting to drown in the crosses. Then the voice yells out ONE THOUSAND and they stop. Still, you can't move. Think about all the numbers being called out, and keep wondering if it'll be the last one. Feel the relief you'd feel if it stops on a thousand, because you won't be buried anymore. The thousand crosses are covering you entirely, over your head, but because they're crosses you can still breathe."}
{"character": "\u30e1", "meaning": "Treasure", "mnemonic": "This radical is treasure because \"X marks the spot,\" as they say. Doesn't it look like the X on a pirate treasure map? You want to go find that treasure now, right?!"}
{"character": "\u6c34", "meaning": "Water", "mnemonic": "There are drops of liquid coming out of both sides of this barb. You can imagine the barb being stuck into the ground then pulled out. When it is, water comes gushing out of both sides! That's why this radical is water."}
{"character": "\u767d", "meaning": "White", "mnemonic": "Add a drop of the sun to something and it will turn it white. The sun is really strong, so even a single drop will burn anything white. Why do you think so many beaches are white? Even the drops of sunblock you use to stop the sun's rays is white. So when you think of sun drops, think white."}
{"character": "\u6587", "meaning": "Writing", "mnemonic": "This looks like a stool with a lid on it, but it's actually a writing desk. Do you see it? It's a nice, quiet place for writing. You can even see the pen sticking up in the middle. Wouldn't you want to do your writing here?"}
{"character": "\u77e2", "meaning": "Arrow", "mnemonic": "You have a really big gun. Why? Because only big guns will be able to shoot arrows! Bullets are pretty small, so the guns that shoot them can be any size. But you need a big gun if you want to shove an arrow in it and then shoot it at your enemies."}
{"character": "\u5e7f", "meaning": "Canopy", "mnemonic": "This is a canopy. See the cloth draping down and the little point at the middle holding it up? You could sit under here and enjoy a bright, summer day without getting any sun!"}
{"character": "\u65b9", "meaning": "Direction", "mnemonic": "This radical looks like a dude running off to the right. He's heading in a very distinct direction. Which direction was it again?"}
{"character": "\u6238", "meaning": "Door", "mnemonic": "Where does a flag usually go? It goes over a door. I know the \u4e00 radical usually means ground, but in this case we're going to say the flag is in the doorway (where the \u4e00 is the top of the door)."}
{"character": "\u5e72", "meaning": "Dry", "mnemonic": "You have two on a stick. Two what? Well, you can't tell because they're too dry. Someone put two somethings on this stick to dry, but they seem to have left them out for way too long. Was it meat? Fish? Cucumbers? You have no clue, but they're two very dry somethings, that's for sure."}
{"character": "\u7236", "meaning": "Father", "mnemonic": "There are fins covering the treasure making up this radical. You pull away the fins and start digging where the X is (because \"X\" marks where the treasure is, right?). When you dig down, instead of finding treasure, you find your father. The shock of this in your imagination should help you to remember the meaning of this radical!"}
{"character": "\u624c", "meaning": "Fingers", "mnemonic": "This looks like the hand (\u624b) radical, but smaller. That's because it's just the fingers. You don't always have room for a whole hand to be in a kanji, but there's always space for a few fingers."}
{"character": "\u6bdb", "meaning": "Fur", "mnemonic": "Do you remember the hair radical? This is like that, except now the hair is attached to a tail. Animals don't usually have hair, though. Instead, they have fur."}
{"character": "\ud840\udda2", "meaning": "Hat", "mnemonic": "Do you know those rice paddy hats? The ones shaped just like this radical? That's why this radical is a hat."}
{"character": "\u5fc3", "meaning": "Heart", "mnemonic": "Take a good look at this one. It kind of looks like a heart (not the stereotypical Valentine\u2019s Day heart, though). Think of a real heart. Basically, there\u2019s a lump (the heart) in the middle, and three lines which make up the arteries that go in and out of the heart to keep you alive. This radical shows up a lot, so it shouldn\u2019t be too hard to learn it as you go along. Remember, lump (heart) plus arteries equals a heart\u2026 like, a real heart, not the fake, pretty kind."}
{"character": "\u51ab", "meaning": "Ice", "mnemonic": "Remember the radical for drop (of liquid)? This is two drops instead of one. When you see two drops, you should think, \"the next stage of water.\" What is the next stage? Why, that is ice."}
{"character": "\u751f", "meaning": "Life", "mnemonic": "This radical consists of a cow radical with the ground radical below it. If you have cows on solid ground, then you really do have a good life, I think. Sometimes this radical will show up without the slide part on the side too, though we'll treat them both as \"life.\""}
{"character": "\u4eca", "meaning": "Now", "mnemonic": "This is a hat on top of the katakana for \"ra.\" Think of Ra, the Egyptian god. When is Ra wearing a hat? Right now! It's always now, because he never takes it off. No really, look it up, it's true."}
{"character": "\u53e4", "meaning": "Old", "mnemonic": "You have a cross on a mouth\u2014that's a pretty religious mouth. Who speaks the most about religion? Old people, mostly. Also, think about the teachings of religion itself - also pretty old, age-wise. No matter how you look at it, everything about this radical is kind of \"old.\""}
{"character": "\u5e7a", "meaning": "Poop", "mnemonic": "There's something sticking out of you while you're in private. It's poop! You can't just poop in public, that's illegal and gross in this day and age. So the next time something starts to come out of you when you're in private, think, \"Ah yes, it's poop.\""}
{"character": "\u5315", "meaning": "Spoon", "mnemonic": "This radical looks like a spoon! Well, a spoon that's been bent a lot by an angry person or a psychic. Go grab a spoon and try to bend it into this shape. Then hold on to it so you'll never forget that this is the spoon radical!"}
{"character": "\u77f3", "meaning": "Stone", "mnemonic": "There's a leaf growing out of a square thing (which is normally a mouth, but not this time). The leaf is growing out of a stone. I mean, obviously, because leaves don't grow out of mouths. I hope. Anyway, picture a stone in the middle of nature with a leaf growing out of it or just behind it and you'll never forget this radical!"}
{"character": "\u53c8", "meaning": "Stool", "mnemonic": "This looks just like a fold-out stool, amiright?"}
{"character": "\u7528", "meaning": "Task", "mnemonic": "This looks a bit like a calendar with spaces for you to write in your tasks for the day. See those blank sections? Make sure you write down your daily tasks, so you don't forget to do something important!"}
{"character": "\u5dfe", "meaning": "Towel", "mnemonic": "There's something draped over that stick. It's a towel!! Imagine taking a wet towel and hanging it over a railing or a stick so it won't get all musty and gross. It would look just like this."}
{"character": "\u2e8c", "meaning": "Triceratops", "mnemonic": "The three horns represent the triceratops, one of the most awesome dinosaurs ever."}
{"character": "\u6bcb", "meaning": "Window", "mnemonic": "See the criss-cross in the pseudo-square shape? That's the frames of a big window you can look out of. It's not perfectly shaped like a rice field, it's more artistic. That's why this is a window and \u7530 is not."}
{"character": "\u5902", "meaning": "Winter", "mnemonic": "This radical looks like the evening radical but has an extra long stroke. That's because evenings are long in the winter. It gets dark super early."}
{"character": "\u4e5f", "meaning": "Alligator", "mnemonic": "See the mouth and teeth of this alligator, which is facing to the right? You wouldn't want to get your hand stuck in there, that's for sure."}
{"character": "\u7af9", "meaning": "Bamboo", "mnemonic": "See how tall the stalks are with little bushy things at the top? It kind of looks like bamboo, if you use your imagination."}
{"character": "\u5df4", "meaning": "Bed", "mnemonic": "You'll have to complete the line on the right side in your mind, but see the rectangle bed and the pillows? This is totally a bed. That missing line is where you pulled back the sheets when you got up this morning."}
{"character": "https://files.wanikani.com/8v0hjy2gh2dnmh1cgbcg8cedpd58", "meaning": "Beggar", "mnemonic": "Doesn't this look like someone on their knees, holding their hands out (clasped) and begging for something (money, their life, etc.)? That's why this radical is known as the beggar."}
{"character": "\u652f", "meaning": "Branch", "mnemonic": "There is a cross growing out of this stool. It's branching off of it, if you will. The tree that this stool was made of is coming back to life in the form of a branch."}
{"character": "\u8eca", "meaning": "Car", "mnemonic": "Doesn't this look like a top-down view of the frame of a car? There are the rods that make up the base of the car and things for the wheels to go on. That's why this radical is the car radical."}
{"character": "\u5f0b", "meaning": "Ceremony", "mnemonic": "This radical looks like a person with a long dress or train running behind them. That's because it's a bride or groom going to their wedding ceremony! You usually have to wear a long dress or a cape if you're at a ceremony. So when you see this radical, think of all the different ceremonies you might have to go to in your life and what you'll need to wear."}
{"character": "\u5382", "meaning": "Cliff", "mnemonic": "See the cliff? It's facing towards the west. What ocean is to your west? That's the direction this cliff is facing."}
{"character": "\u8033", "meaning": "Ear", "mnemonic": "This radical is a bit more elaborate than the eye, though similar. In fact, if you go blind, your ears become one of your new senses of sight, which is why this is like another, somewhat modified, eye. You'll even notice little lines sticking out of the eye. That's because ears stick out more than eyes (\u76ee), which is why this radical is the ear radical."}
{"character": "\u6c14", "meaning": "Energy", "mnemonic": "This radical is shaped kind of like a dam. See the wall and the water pushing over the top? If this radical is a dam, then it must create a ton of energy as well!"}
{"character": "\u8279", "meaning": "Flowers", "mnemonic": "See the little things sticking out of the ground? Those little things are pretty little flowers. You know they're flowers and not, say, grass, because they're spaced out. You'll learn grass later, and it will be less spaced out, but somewhat similar to this, so keep that in mind!"}
{"character": "\u8db3", "meaning": "Foot", "mnemonic": "Do you see the dude doing a flying dragon kick to the right? What does he hit the target with? Obviously it's his foot."}
{"character": "\u5196", "meaning": "Forehead", "mnemonic": "Sure, this forehead is a bit square, but that's because it's Frankenstein's Monster's forehead. Also, did you notice that this is just the top part of the head (\u5182) radical? This is just the forehead part of that!"}
{"character": "\u4e37", "meaning": "Horns", "mnemonic": "Can you see the horns? You could put these horns on anything. Donkeys, people, monkeys, and so on. That's exactly what we'll be doing when we learn kanji that have horns too."}
{"character": "\u866b", "meaning": "Insect", "mnemonic": "There is something private in your mouth. You're keeping it private because you don't want other people to judge you. Why? Because it's an insect. You like to eat insects, but society seems to think it's wrong. Don't worry, friend. Someday the rest of the world will embrace eating insects like you have."}
{"character": "\uff72", "meaning": "Leader", "mnemonic": "This radical technically means person (like \u4eba), but we're going to shift the meaning a little bit. It's kind of like the person radical, but it's taller and skinnier, standing above the rest of those peons. That's why this is a leader, not a regular old person."}
{"character": "\u5f73", "meaning": "Loiter", "mnemonic": "The leader (\uff72) radical has a little something extra on top of him, holding him down, holding him back. It's causing him to wait... it's causing him to loiter."}

{"character": "\u5bf8", "meaning": "Measurement", "mnemonic": "Have you ever used one of those math compasses? This looks just like one of those because this is the measurement radical. Compasses are used to measure things, just like this."}
{"character": "\u4e0d", "meaning": "Not", "mnemonic": "If you see this radical in a kanji, you'll want to think of the opposite of whatever other radicals there are. It looks a lot like \"below,\" but guess what? It's not the below radical. It's just not."}
{"character": "\u5143", "meaning": "Origin", "mnemonic": "You have two legs making up this radical. Between two legs is where you came from, no matter how you look at it. These two legs are your origin."}
{"character": "\u5140", "meaning": "Pi", "mnemonic": "Obviously, this looks just like the good ol' 3.14 something-something all people are supposed to learn about. It's the math symbol that has to do with circles... pi!"}

{"character": "\u7c73", "meaning": "Rice", "mnemonic": "Not to be confused with a rice paddy (\u7530). This is just raw rice, like the grain that grows out of the ground when rice is raw and fresh. When rice is particularly ripe, it'll kind of look like this at the top of the stalks. See the long leaves with the little rice tufts at the top? That's why this radical is \"rice.\""}
{"character": "\u5b80", "meaning": "Roof", "mnemonic": "This is a roof. You know it's a roof and not a forehead because there's a little chimney sticking out of the top. And foreheads definitely don't have chimneys."}
{"character": "\u58eb", "meaning": "Samurai", "mnemonic": "The samurai radical looks a lot like the dirt radical. The difference is in the top horizontal line. For samurai, the top is longer because he's holding swords. Dirt can't really hold anything because its arms are too short. So when you see this radical, think: long arms for some long swords. That's a samurai!"}
{"character": "\u898b", "meaning": "See", "mnemonic": "There's an eyeball on top of some legs. When your eyes get taken places (on legs, in this case), your eyes are seeing those things. That's why this radical means see."}

{"character": "\u7cf8", "meaning": "Thread", "mnemonic": "There is something small in some poop. You lean in, carefully pull it out, and realize it's a thread. Why is there some thread in this small poop? Because it's cat poop. And cats love to eat thread when you aren't looking. And floss and hoodie strings and mouse tails. But this poop just has thread in it."}
{"character": "\u4e5a", "meaning": "Umbrella", "mnemonic": "Do you know how the bottom of an umbrella is shaped? It has a hook that curls around for the handle. So when you see this radical, you should think of the bottom of an umbrella, which will help you remember that it means umbrella."}
{"character": "\u4e16", "meaning": "World", "mnemonic": "There are no circles in kanji, remember? So imagine that these angles are really circles. A little circle in a big circle, with a line running through them. Why, it's the world. The world looks just like this, with continents on the globe and a line is the equator. Can you see it?"}
{"character": "\u65a4", "meaning": "Axe", "mnemonic": "This is a strange looking axe, I know. But think of it this way: the letter \"T\" is in the cliff. What is the \"T\"? Of course it has to be Mr. T, who's super awesome. Think of Mr. T wielding a terrifying axe, running after you screaming, \"I pity the fool!\" while trying to chop you down. That makes for a pretty terrifying axe."}
{"character": "\u9752", "meaning": "Blue", "mnemonic": "You have life on top of the moon (ignore that life is missing its little slide on the left side). What would life on the moon look like? Well, first of all, they have no air, so they probably look pretty blue from asphyxiation. When you meet them, it turns out you're right. They're a civilization of blue people. Imagine them all living up there, being blue and Smurfy."}
{"character": "\u8002", "meaning": "Coffin", "mnemonic": "See the slide going into the dirt? That's where they throw your body when you die. It's actually a coffin!"}
{"character": "\u8272", "meaning": "Color", "mnemonic": "The bed you get in prison is the only thing with color you'll see while you're there. Picture a dark, dank cell. Maybe a toilet too. Now picture a bright, colorful bed against the wall. This is the only joy you have."}

{"character": "\u5f00", "meaning": "Lantern", "mnemonic": "Think of an old-style lantern. It's on top of a few legs (you can only see two from this angle) and it's in a box shaped holder at the top. You can imagine these lining the streets before electricity, right? That's why this radical is a lantern."}
{"character": "\u53ef", "meaning": "Lip Ring", "mnemonic": "There's something hooked going into a mouth. Rather than a hook, though, it's a lip ring. They used to use fish hooks and nails in the old days. (Glad we don't live in those times anymore!)"}
{"character": "\u8089", "meaning": "Meat", "mnemonic": "Inside your head, you can only think about people, people, and more people. This is bad, because really all you want is their meat, because you're some kind of sick cannibal... you monster.

{"character": "\u4f1a", "meaning": "Meet", "mnemonic": "Under the hat there are two people meeting in private. Look at them huddled up in there. They must have a reason to want to meet in such a private place, but that's not for you to judge. Maybe next time you have to meet with someone you'll hide under a hat with them too."}

{"character": "\u6c35", "meaning": "Tsunami", "mnemonic": "You've seen one drop (\u4e36), but what happens when you triple this and have three drops, which happens to be the maximum number of drops you can have? You end up with a devastating tsunami, because there's too much water and nowhere for it to go. Just think of this as a lot of water. When you have a lot of water, you have a tsunami."}

{"character": "\u897f", "meaning": "West", "mnemonic": "You have pi coming out of a mouth. \"3.14,\" it says. We must take the secret of the circle with us, away from here. We must go to a magical place where nobody will persecute us for our math... a place to the West!"}

{"character": "\u30db", "meaning": "Angel", "mnemonic": "First of all, there's a cross making up the middle, which automatically makes this a religion-based radical. That cross is the frame of someone's body and the things coming off of it are wings. This is an angel."}
{"character": "\u8840", "meaning": "Blood", "mnemonic": "There's a little speck of something on your plate (\u76bf). \"What is that?\" you ask. Oh no... that speck is BLOOD!!! I hope it's blood from a nosebleed you suddenly have and not someone else's blood. (Your waiter is probably gonna get fired, btw.) At least your platelets should stop the bleeding soon. Haha, get it? PLATE-lets? Japanese blood jokes."}
{"character": "\u706c", "meaning": "Boil", "mnemonic": "This radical looks like the fire from the burner of a stove or the steam coming up off of a pot of water. That's because this is the boil radical. You need to boil a bunch of water over some flames. This radical looks like all of those parts at once!"}
{"character": "\u51f5", "meaning": "Box", "mnemonic": "This box is open. There could be any number of things inside, but for now all you need to know is the meaning of this radical, which is box."}
{"character": "\u5e02", "meaning": "City", "mnemonic": "You already learned the kanji \u5e02, which means city. We're treating it as a radical too, since it pops up in many other kanji. When used as a radical, it still means city. "}
{"character": "\u4ea1", "meaning": "Death", "mnemonic": "There's a lid on a lion. And you're stuck under the lid with the lion, which means you will surely meet your death.

{"character": "\u98df", "meaning": "Eat", "mnemonic": "You put on your hat and go outside to kick something white. It's a big white goose and you killed it with your kick. That's because you're going to cook and eat it. Yum!"}
{"character": "\u5360", "meaning": "Fortune", "mnemonic": "Someone has a toe in their mouth. They are a fortune teller telling your fortune. But for her to do it, she has to take one of your toes and taste it. This better be a good fortune for you to let someone put your foot in their mouth."}

{"character": "\u6597", "meaning": "Ladle", "mnemonic": "There's a ladle scooping up two drops of liquid. See the handle and the scoop part of the ladle? Imagine ladling some water into your mouth. Mmm."}

{"character": "\u6b79", "meaning": "Yakuza", "mnemonic": "The evening radical is under the ground. Who's doing things underground at night? The Yakuza. Picture Yakuza members sneaking around in the subway, or in the sewers. They're definitely up to no good down there."}

{"character": "\u9ed2", "meaning": "Black", "mnemonic": "If you boil a village everything will turn black. Mostly because you're a crazed murderer, but more so because when you boil a village all the roads melt and coat everything in black tar. Picture it! It looks like Pompeii. (Oof, too soon?)"}

{"character": "\u6c0f", "meaning": "Clan", "mnemonic": "This looks like a little tamagotchi or (if you aren't a 90s kid) a duck. What do both of these critters have in common? They have really crazy clan followings. And the people who enjoy them (tiny pocket games or watching quacking duckies) create clans that get together and share their experiences. Which clan are you a part of?"}

{"character": "\u5df1", "meaning": "Oneself", "mnemonic": "This looks a bit like a backwards S. S for Self. But it's backwards because you didn't want to mix yourself up with any of the other selves out there, so you flipped it. That's why it means oneself. (That's you!)"}
{"character": "\u8c55", "meaning": "Pig", "mnemonic": "Here we have the ground radical, with something underneath it. What is it? What likes lying in the ground, covered in mud?

{"character": "\u9ec4", "meaning": "Yellow", "mnemonic": "Flowers that grow out of the ground of a rice paddy after you bury fins there will grow yellow. Why? Because yellow is the color of a fish's soul, so planting flowers over their fins will turn them into a nice, pretty yellow. "}
{"character": "\u531a", "meaning": "Cage", "mnemonic": "This radical is a cage because it's covered on all sides but one (the one open side is where the cage door or gate is). There's nothing inside this cage because there's no gate, and whatever was inside has gotten out. I hope it wasn't rabid..."}

{"character": "\u4e91", "meaning": "Cloud", "mnemonic": "This is the radical for cloud. See how the cloud is puffy on the bottom but has two lines up top? That's because a plane flew through it. If humans didn't invent planes, this cloud radical might look different. Really makes you think, huh?"}
{"character": "\u6bd4", "meaning": "Compare", "mnemonic": "This radical is made up of two slightly different versions of the spoon radical (which you should already know).

{"character": "\u7a74", "meaning": "Hole", "mnemonic": "You have a roof on top of what looks like a volcano. What is the roof covering on the top of the volcano?

It looks similar, with the wing on the bottom and the shape on top, but it doesn't have a feather sticking out of the top of its head and it has a long, thick neck.

{"character": "\u5df3", "meaning": "Snake", "mnemonic": "There's two ways to remember this one. First, you could look at this and see it's a coiled up snake. Or, if you want, you can imagine it as a snake head, with its face facing to the right (see its open mouth?).

{"character": "\u5408", "meaning": "Suit", "mnemonic": "You find a hat on the ground with a mouth as the design on the front. You think it looks weird, but when you put it on, you find it suits you quite well. Imagine yourself feeling not so sure about this hat at first. But, once you put it on, you feel pleasantly surprised."}
{"character": "\u6bb3", "meaning": "Weapon", "mnemonic": "Stick a table on top of a stool and you end up with a very dangerous weapon. Imagine hitting someone with this thing!

{"character": "\u53f2", "meaning": "History", "mnemonic": "A mouth that's talking about treasure... that sounds more like ancient history to me.

{"character": "\u4ecb", "meaning": "Jammed In", "mnemonic": "This radical kind of looks like an arrow, but not an ordinary one. It's curvy and forced, right? Like it's trying to tell you something is being jammed in to wherever it's pointing."}

{"character": "\u8f9b", "meaning": "Spicy", "mnemonic": "You're standing up on top of a cross. Why? Because you ate something so spicy that it caused you to beg Jesus for mercy. You need to save your mouth from the spicy flames. To make sure he hears you, you stand up on the closest cross. Make sure to feel how spicy this is in your mouth to remember it better!"}
